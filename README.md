# Recipe Box

The Recipe Box site is an easy to use online portal to store your favourite recipes.  Many people, myself included, have numerous cookbooks that
we keep for just one or two recipes along with old handwritten pieces of paper with recipes handed down from other people. Storing this information in our 
kitchens adds to clutter and it can be difficult to find something when you are looking for it.  This site offers a solution to input the recipes you have on hand
and store them for easy access.

Online recipes have seen an explosiion of growth the past number of years as bloogers aided by Pinterest and Instagram contine to share recipes 
and many people have begun online collections which are easy to use and find what you are looking for.  The old favourites which are stored on hard copies
can be impossible to integrate into this system as most people don't have their own blog or website where they can share them.  This site aims to solve this problem 
and will enable everyone to store their recipes electronically, saving time, space and frustration.  

## UX
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

### Existing Features
Navigation bar - The Navbar is located at the top to easily move around the site and to access all other parts of the site.  The feature is mobile
friendly.  

Search by Category Page - The main page or search page is divided by category and allows the user to easily find the recipes they are looking for broken down by meal.
Typically when searching for recipes you are looking for a dessert to make or something for dinner.  This is the easiest way to divide the recipes for easiest access for the user.
The features left to implement section describes additional search capability that would be added in the future.

### Features Left to Implement
Future enhancements would include: 
1.  User log in and personalized experience
2.  Greater search capability, including search by keywords, ingredients, cooking time
3.  Sharing tools so recipes could be shared on Pinterest or other social media sites
4.  Links to sites to purchase required tools or ingredients to support revenue stream for site owner. 

## Technologies Used
**[HTML](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/)**
  The basic structure and display page was created using HTML.

**[CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html)**
  Design and enhancement of user experience was done with CSS to make it a site that is both easy to read and navigate. 

**[JavaScript](http://www.ecmascript.org/)**
  Used to provide the search, map and display functionality.

**[JQuery](https://jquery.com/)**
  Used to simplify the code in places and to simplify DOM movements.

**[Materalize](https://materializecss.com/)**

**[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)**

## Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
